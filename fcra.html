It is important for consumers to take an active role in monitoring the accuracy and completeness of their consumer reports and not merely react after credit or employment is denied because of an inaccurate consumer report.</p>

<!-- Paragraph -->
            <p><span class="first">Y</span>our credit reports are essentially the lifeblood of your financial health, and if one or more negative items winds up on them, the consequences include lower credit scores, diminished opportunities when it comes to opening credit cards or taking out loans and even possibly getting passed over for jobs and apartment rentals. We’ve talked in the past about how important it is to regularly check your credit reports — there are three of them, one from each of the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — for any errors that might be affecting your credit in a negative manner. If something shows up that you know you weren’t responsible for, it is possible to get it removed by filing a dispute. If you’re curious about the process, keep reading for an in-depth guide on how to dispute an incorrect item and get it removed from your credit reports.

            <p><span class="first">N</span>o matter how minor, if you find inaccurate information in your credit report you should dispute it in writing. And keep a scanned copy. Phone numbers and addresses are included in your credit report. Identity thieves routinely use false addresses or phone numbers when opening fraudulent accounts. Be especially wary of addresses and phone numbers that seem correct - those that are almost your phone number or a family member that you visit but have never lived with. Identity thieves know that they are easily overlooked and that family members are likely to throw away what they deem as spam mail. Fortunately, incorrect addresses and phone numbers are the easiest to correct. If you find an address or phone number that you do not recognize dispute it immediately (again, in writing - keep a scanned copy).</p>
