            <p><span class="first">I</span>dentity theft is the fastest growing crime in America. Data breaches have become startlingly common and it would be a safe bet to assume your personal data has been stolen.  With any luck, you will not be a victim of identity theft but vigilance in this area is unfortunalely necessary.</p>

            <svg class="bullet bullet-one" width="26" height="26"><circle cx="13" cy="13" r="13"></circle></svg><span class="headline">Check Your Credit Report</span>
         
              <p><span class="first">T</span>he best first step in protecting yourself from identity theft is to check your credit report annually. If you find something incorrect it is best to dispute negative information with all three credit bureaus in writing. You can dispute information online but the online forms contain manditory arbitration agreements that you do not have to agree to when submitting a written request.</p>

            <svg class="bullet bullet-two" width="26" height="26"><circle cx="13" cy="13" r="13"></circle></svg><span class="headline">File an Identity Theft Affidavit</span>

              <p><span class="first">T</span>he next step is to visit <a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/" target="_blank">IdentityTheft.gov</a> a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website where you can generate an identity theft affidavit. This affidavit will be helpful when contacting the credit card company or other type of creditor about the identity theft. The creditor might also require you to complete a police report in order to process your complaint, but often the FTC affidavit will be enough to start an investigation.</p>

              <p><span class="first">A</span>fter you’ve determined the size and scope of the identity theft, the next step is to cut off the identity thief’s access to your credit lines or other financial information. To stop any unauthorized use, you can contact each reporting agency and ask for a “credit freeze,” which is an alert that you place on your credit information. The credit reporting agencies will all tell you that they will report the freeze to the other credit reporting agencies and they are required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act to do so, but call all three anyway. You are a victim and you need to take care of yourself.</p>
              <p><span class="first">A</span> credit freeze won’t stop you from being able to use your credit, but you will have to approve each use. For instance, once the credit freeze is in place, a lender must contact you and verify that you are the person who asked for the new line of credit before approving the account. So if you’re renting a new place to live, buying a new car, or making some other use of your credit, you might have to lift the freeze temporarily.</p>

              <p><span class="first">I</span>f the perpetrator compromises your bank account, you’ll want to close it as soon as possible and open a new one. Federal law limits the amount of money you can lose through the unauthorized use of your bank accounts, credit cards, or debit cards, but you must report the problem promptly to take advantage of the protection.
          </p>
          <p><span class="first">U</span>nfortunately, the credit reporting agencies routinely take advantage of identity theft victims when they call to request a freeze on their accounts by trying to sell them credit monitoring services. These services are not necessary and they are expensive. If you follow the steps I have provided and keep documentation of your correspondence and telephone calls, you should be able to resolve this favorably on your own. If you have taken these steps and the creditor is still reporting negative information related to identity theft, it might be necessary to file a lawsuit.
